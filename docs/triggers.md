title: Triggers
order: 1

The trigger decides when an automation runs. Every automation has one.

## Picking hosts

Most triggers watch hosts. Pick one host, a [fleet](/plugins/fleets), or all hosts.

A fleet is usually best. Tag a new server and it is covered without editing the automation.

## Metric threshold

Runs when a number crosses a line, like memory used over 90 percent. Needs [Host Metrics](/plugins/host-metrics).

| Metric                                                                         | What it measures               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `cpu.percent`                                                                  | CPU use, percent.              |
| `cpu.load1`, `cpu.load5`, `cpu.load15`                                         | Load average.                  |
| `memory.percent`, `memory.usedGiB`                                             | Memory used.                   |
| `disk.percent`, `disk.availableBytes`                                          | Disk used, for one mount.      |
| `temperature.highestCelsius`                                                   | The hottest sensor.            |
| `uptime.seconds`                                                               | How long the host has been up. |
| `processes.total`                                                              | Running processes.             |
| `network.rxBytes`, `network.txBytes`, `network.rxRateBps`, `network.txRateBps` | Traffic, for one interface.    |

**Sustained for** stops false alarms. The value has to stay over the line that long before anything runs. CPU at 100 percent for two seconds is normal. For five minutes it isn't.

**Cooldown** is how long to wait before it can fire again for the same host. 15 minutes by default, so a value that wobbles around the line doesn't message you over and over.

## Host goes up or down

Runs when a host goes offline or comes back. When Termix first sees a host it only records its state, so a restart of Termix doesn't make every host look like it just came online.

## Health check changes

Runs when a health check from [Host Metrics](/plugins/host-metrics) starts failing or recovers. Watch one check or all of them.

## On a schedule

Runs on a clock, with a cron expression like `0 3 * * *` (3am every day) or an interval in seconds. Pick a **Time zone** so daily runs land at the right local time, through daylight saving changes too.

Schedules are checked every 15 seconds, so a run can start a few seconds late.

## Container event

Runs when a container is `exited`, `started`, `unhealthy` or `restarting`. Watch one container by name or all of them. Needs [Docker](/plugins/docker).

## Termix event

Runs when something happens in Termix:

| Event                        | When                                               |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_login`                 | Someone signs in.                                  |
| `host_added`, `host_deleted` | A host is made or deleted.                         |
| `tunnel_disconnected`        | A tunnel drops. Needs [Tunnels](/plugins/tunnels). |
| `automation_failed`          | Another automation fails.                          |

Set up one automation on `automation_failed` early. Then you hear when any other automation breaks.

## Incoming webhook

Runs when something outside Termix calls a URL: CI, a monitor, a script.

When you save the trigger, Termix shows the webhook URL once. Copy it then. Only a hash is kept, so it can't be shown again. Lost it? Make a new trigger.

```bash
curl -X POST https://termix.example.com/plugin-api/automations/webhook/YOUR_TOKEN
```

Anyone with the URL can start the automation. Treat it like a password.

## After a restart

Hold timers and cooldowns are saved, so restarting Termix doesn't reset them.
